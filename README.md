# Project objective
  This project aims to leverage data science to analyze and gain actionable insights from a messy real estate dataset. The core objective is to move from raw, inconsistent data to a comprehensive understanding of the factors that drive property prices. The analysis will follow a structured approach, starting with extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies. Once the data is refined, it will be used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns. The project's ultimate goal is to build and evaluate a predictive model that can accurately estimate property prices. The analysis will conclude with a deeper dive into advanced topics like geospatial analysis and market segmentation through clustering to provide a holistic view of the real estate market.

  The data for this project is sourced from the publicly available "A messy house price dataset" from Kaggle:
